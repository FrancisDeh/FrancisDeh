### Welcome, 👋 am Francis Deh, Software Engineer!
---
**⚡ Fun fact:** I like to play around things related to development and finally have a deep commitment to specialization.

- It started with a journey with Java for Android Development, back in the days when Google was yet to accept Kotlin into the family.

- At least one cool app got to playstore, 😄 .. :+1:
Then i got into Php and  Html, Css and Jquery even before vanilla JavaScript. :shipit:

- Along the way, 😋 @laravel found me, so yeah, the life of frameworks got hold of me.. and this was me in level 200, UCC, like 3 years ago.
We did some awesome stuffs with it, @nakjemmy
- Then @flutter came along, remember the first app built in Java that went to playstore, yeah, that one, guess what, ❔ version 2.0 was re-written in Flutter 🔥

- They said bootsrap @twbs is bae, 🤝, but materializecss @Dogfalo is just ... 🚶 🤭
- Because @vuejs comes out of the box with Laravel, i tried it, and 💥, it was nothing to regret
- At what point @firebase hit me, i dont know, but it was a good companion for cloud stuffs and serverless things. we walked a long while, we still walk 🚶

- So i cemented my skillset around these and with curiosity jumped on @angular, springboot @dsyer and @django 😝

**⚡ Fun fact:** Now at @turntabl doing cool stuffs with folks like @Setriakor @idawud @ERASTUS-DOH @Ankomahene, @SethKwashie, @larteyjoshua, @dicksonnicholas7

- I am very passionate about `Software Architecture`, the very world of microservices, studying them ( the likes of Netflix, Uber etc) and learning to build with them. 
- ☁️ Cloud platforms are no exception..
- and AI
- and anything else that embraces me. Its a life long learning
